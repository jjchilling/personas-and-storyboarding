            <h1>Part 2: Recording Observations</h1>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">The following page shows the result of the interviews. After receiving their permission to record and take notes as they were running laundry, I was able to organize their workflow as the following.</p>
            <br>
            <ul class="fade-in paragraph">
                <li><strong>User Workflow:</strong> The user follows a pre-established process when doing laundry, completing each step before moving on to the next.</li>
                <li><strong>Sorting & Preparation:</strong> Users typically separate their laundry by color before adding detergent and closing the washer.</li>
                <li><strong>Interface Interaction:</strong> Users use the kiosk to add their washers and take out their student ID to make the payment.</li>
                <li><strong>Confirmation Behavior:</strong> Before starting the wash cycle, users take a moment (approximately 5 seconds) to observe the washer settings.</li>
                <li><strong>Payment Process:</strong> Users swipe their card and confirm payment via student ID before initiating the machine.</li>
                <li><strong>Dryer Interaction:</strong> The drying process is similar the washing process, with users checking dryer settings before proceeding.</li>
                <li><strong>Final Steps:</strong> Once the cycle is complete, users transfer laundry to their bin and leave the room.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Anonymous Student A</h1>
            <p class="fade-in question">1. What year are you, and do you live in a dorm or off campus?</p>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">I'm a junior, and I live in a dorm.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="fade-in question">2. How often do you do laundry, and what time of day do you usually prefer to do it?</p>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">A little embarrassed to admit this, I run laundry every two weeks. I run laundry during really odd hours, because I do not like competing for the machines. So 1 am, or sometimes 2 am.</p>
            <br>

            <p class="fade-in question">3. Can you describe your overall experience running laundry?</p>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">Honestly, not great, because I always have a lot of clothes to wash. I have a lot of sweaters, coats, jeans, hoodies...So carrying that to the laundry room and dealing with switching machines can be a lot of work.</p>
            <br>

            <p class="fade-in question">4. How would you describe the process of using the laundry interface? Are there any areas where you feel it could be more intuitive? </p>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">The settings are generally fine to navigate, but sometimes you have to press on the kiosk really hard, which is annoying. I also don't like that the card reader requires you select "pay with student ID" after swiping, because it's an unnecessary additional step.</p>
            <br>

            <p class="fade-in question">5. What features or aspects of the laundry kiosk do you find most useful or convenient?</p>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">I like kiosk screen, because it allows me to review my laundry settings before starting. </p>
            <br>

            <p class="fade-in question">6. Are there any challenges or frustrations you've encountered while using the interface? If so, can you describe them?</p>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">A frustration I have would be the fact that I have to change the settings manually on each machine. If possible, it would be great if the laundry machine and the kiosk can be unified. If I could just change settings on the kiosk and start the machines right away, that would shave a couple minutes off my laundry trips. </p>

            <h1>Anonymous Student B</h1>
            <p class="fade-in question">1. What year are you, and do you live in a dorm or off campus?</p>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">I'm a sophomore, and I live in a dorm.</p>
            
            <p class="fade-in question">2. How often do you do laundry, and what time of day do you usually prefer to do it?</p>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">Every week. I usually run them on weekday afternoons. </p>
            <br>

            <p class="fade-in question">3. Can you describe your overall experience running laundry?</p>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">Generally it's not too horrible. I have light loads besides when I have to wash my sheets. It does take up a decent chunk of my time during the day, so that would be the only factor that bothers me.</p>
            <br>

            <p class="fade-in question">4. How would you describe the process of using the laundry interface? Are there any areas where you feel it could be more intuitive? </p>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">I think the laundry interface is generally intuitive. If I had to note a few things, the laundry detergent compartment of the washers have really tiny letters engraved for where the softener goes and detergent goes, so that's hard to see during the first time. Also, my card freshman year, I didn't realize you had to flip your card facing towards the triangle mark for the transaction, so I wish that was a little more clear as well.</p>
            <br>

            <p class="fade-in question">5. What features or aspects of the laundry kiosk do you find most useful or convenient?</p>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">I like the responsiveness of the kiosk. Usually, when I click on a button on the machine, the change reflects immediately.</p>
            <br>

            <p class="fade-in question">6. Are there any challenges or frustrations you've encountered while using the interface? If so, can you describe them?</p>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">This might be more of a hardware issue, but the machines often disconnect from the internet or the kiosk, which prevents you from starting a cycle. I wish the connection was more stable.</p>

            <p class="fade-in question">1. What year are you, and do you live in a dorm or off campus?</p>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">I'm a junior, and I live in a dorm.</p>

            <p class="fade-in question">2. How often do you do laundry, and what time of day do you usually prefer to do it?</p>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">It depends every time, but I would say around every 10 days. Time wise, I usually run it in the morning on weekends. If I can't on weekends, I run it some random time in the afternoon. </p>
            <br>

            <p class="fade-in question">3. Can you describe your overall experience running laundry?</p>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">Running laundry is a lot of work for me because I live on the third floor. For the laundry system, the washers have unpredictable behaviors at times. For instance, if a cycle is supposed to take 36 minutes, and I come back after my alarm rings, there is still additional 5-7 minutes remaining for some reason. So it makes it necessary for me to check the remaining time on the laundry app.</p>

            <p class="fade-in question">4. How would you describe the process of using the laundry interface? Are there any areas where you feel it could be more intuitive? </p>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">I think it's easy to use. I suppose sometimes, the card reader takes too long to register my card swipes, so I have to swipe up and down multiple times and wait. </p>
            <br>

            <p class="fade-in question">5.What features or aspects of the laundry kiosk do you find most useful or convenient?</p>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">I like that the settings buttons are generally intuitive. In particular, I like that the washer lets you decide between light, medium, and heavy wash, because I sometimes get stains on my clothings.</p>
            <br>

            <p class="fade-in question">6. Are there any challenges or frustrations you've encountered while using the interface? If so, can you describe them?</p>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">The card swipes often do not register properly, so I always have to swipe at least three times. I wish I could scan my card instead of swiping it.</p>
