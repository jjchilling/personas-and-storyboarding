            <p class="fade-in paragraph">I chose to analyze the laundry ecosystem at Brown University, which includes the laundry kiosk, washer, and dryer. Since these components are often used together as a unit, I decided to examine the user experience of all three.</p>

            <h1>Interview Questions</h1>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">The following 6 questions were asked to 3 students who have interacted with the laundry interface at Brown. Two of them were conducted while they were actively running laundry, and one was conducted while they were carrying their basket upstairs. The interview begins with a short demographic question and leads to series of open-ended questions about the laundry system at Brown. For this interview, I referenced "Dillman - The Basics of Crafting Good Questions."</p>
            <br>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">1. What year are you, and do you live in a dorm or off campus?</p>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">2. How often do you do laundry, and what time of day do you usually prefer to do it?</p>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">3. Can you describe your overall experience using the laundry system?</p>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">4. How would you describe the process of using the laundry interface? Are there any areas where you feel it could be more intuitive? </p>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">5.What features or aspects of the laundry kiosk do you find most useful or convenient?</p>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">6. Are there any challenges or frustrations you've encountered while using the interface? If so, can you describe them?</p>
            <br>
            <p class="fade-in paragraph">Based on these interviews, I recorded their responses and crafted a persona that depicts their experience. Please refer to the Observations page for the interviews. </p>
